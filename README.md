# **How Organizational Culture Influences Non-Technical System Attributes**

**Objective:**  
Discuss how the culture in an organization can affect important non-functional requirements (system qualities) such as:

- **Performance (Ytelse)**  
- **Maintainability (Driftbarhet)**  
- **Reliability (Driftssikkerhet)**  
- **Availability (Tilgjengelighet)**  

**Scenario:**  
Imagine you are implementing a new software system inside a large organization with a complex value chain. Different departments are responsible for different parts of the system.

**Instructions:**
1. Form into small groups.
2. Assume the organization has a **pathological** or **bureaucratic** culture.
3. Discuss:  
   - What problems could arise related to **performance**, **maintainability**, **reliability**, and **availability** because of the culture?
4. Then, discuss:  
   - What challenges could happen if **different departments** have **different cultures**? (e.g., some are pathological, some are bureaucratic, some are generative)

**Background:**  
You have already learned about Westrum's classification of organizational cultures:  
- **Pathological** (power-oriented, information hoarding)  
- **Bureaucratic** (rule-oriented, information protection)  
- **Generative** (performance-oriented, information flow encouraged)

**Tips for Your Discussion:**
- How would a **pathological culture** impact system handovers, bug fixing, downtime handling, or system updates?
- What happens to **reliability** when different teams don't trust each other or don't share information easily?
- How might a **generative department** clash with a **bureaucratic one** when trying to improve system maintainability?
- Think about everyday scenarios: communication delays, blame games, refusal to collaborate, or silos.

**Deliverable:**  
Prepare a short summary with:
- Key problems you identified for each system attribute
- An example of how cultural differences between departments could make things worse

You will present your main findings briefly to the class.
